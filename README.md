# Getting started

The project is a simple to-do list app created with class components with a purpose of learning 
how to deal with them. The tasks don't save themselves anywhere, so don't try using this app for storage purposes.


## v1.0:
### Bugs: 
All the tasks that are added are doubled

### Also 
Styles are missing but whatever

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
